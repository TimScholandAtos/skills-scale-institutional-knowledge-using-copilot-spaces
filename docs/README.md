# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This collection of documents provides comprehensive guidance on how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects to deliver product features, services, and integrations.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of small testable increments, clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, data-informed decision-making, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. The framework emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement across all project phases—from initiation through retrospective. Each project follows a structured lifecycle while maintaining flexibility to adapt to team needs and project complexity.

Our project management processes involve clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications while maintaining project documentation and facilitating key meetings. Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success through customer value metrics. Developers implement features collaboratively with attention to design and testability, while QA validates quality against acceptance criteria. Stakeholders provide essential inputs and approvals throughout the project lifecycle. This role clarity ensures accountability and enables efficient cross-functional collaboration.

Communication and quality assurance are integral to our project delivery. Teams maintain regular cadences including weekly PM and Product Manager syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates, supplemented by ad-hoc escalations when needed. Projects utilize standard artifacts such as project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, and risk registers to maintain alignment. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing strategies including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance. Our pull request workflow emphasizes small PRs with clear acceptance criteria, automated testing, and peer review before merging.

The retrospective and continuous improvement culture at OctoAcme ensures that learnings translate into actionable improvements. After each sprint, release, or important milestone, teams conduct structured retrospectives to identify what went well and what could be improved, prioritizing 2-3 top action items to avoid overload. Risk management is proactive with regular assessment of impact and likelihood, clear mitigation plans, and escalation paths from team level through sponsor level. This disciplined yet flexible approach enables OctoAcme to deliver high-quality products while continuously refining processes based on team feedback and measured outcomes.
